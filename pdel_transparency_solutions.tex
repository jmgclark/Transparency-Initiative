\section{Motivation}
\subsection{}
	\begin{frame}
		``\nb{Academia is a social enterprise} that is usually most successful when individual researchers \nb{compete and collaborate} in contributing toward common goals. 
		
		\bigskip
		In contrast, when we work in isolation on unrelated problems, ignoring work that has come before, we lose the benefits of evaluating each other's work, analyzing the same problem from different perspectives, improving measurement techniques and methods, and, most important, \nb{building on existing work rather than repeatedly reinventing the wheel}."
		
		\bigskip
		 -- Gary King 1995, p. 445
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{(Social) Science!}
		 In order to \nb{accumulate knowledge}, we need to be able to replicate and extend the work that came before. This means we need to know:
		 
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item The universe of previous studies
		 	\item Their methods and specifications
		 	\item Their results (from ALL studies, not just the ones that got published!)
		 \end{itemize}
		 \bigskip
		 
		 $\rightarrow$ Requires research \nb{transparency}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Without transparency, we have issues ...}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{``Replication crisis"}--- studies fail to replicate (psych, econ, polisci, medicine, etc.)
			\item \textbf{Publication bias} --- published studies only represent fraction of results, biased toward significant positive findings
			\item \textbf{P-hacking/researcher degrees of freedom} --- published studies use only a fraction of possible specifications, biased toward significance 
			\item \textbf{Misconduct/fraud} --- easier to get away with!
		\end{itemize}			
		\bigskip
		
		$\rightarrow$ \nb{fragmented} and \nb{biased} body of knowledge
		
	\end{frame}
	
%%%%% REPLICATION CRISIS	
	
	\begin{frame}{``Replication Crisis"}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Problem:} In the past decade, many studies have failed to replicate across the social, behavioral, and medical sciences 
			\item \nb{\textbf{Ideally}}, replications help determine if original results are robust to alternative specifications or if they were due to \textit{random chance}.
			\item \nb{\textbf{In reality}}, failure to replicate often a result of ...
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Lack of transparency in sharing data/code
						\item Errors in data/code
						\item Misconduct or fraud 
					\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

%%%%% PUBLICATION BIAS

	\begin{frame}{Publication Bias}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{``The File Drawer Problem":} Studies more likely to be published when findings are significant $\rightarrow$ studies with null (or negative) findings are hidden
			\item \textbf{Result:} Missing full universe of studies and results; what we believe to be a solid body of evidence could be due to random chance (e.g., if we expect 5\% of results of all studies to be significant)
		\end{itemize}		
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Publication Bias}

%%%%% P-HACKING

	\begin{frame}{About P-Hacking (AKA fishing, data mining, specification searching, etc.)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Motive:} Researchers have incentives (from journals, tenure requirements, etc.) to find significance
			\item \textbf{Opportunity:} Researchers also have many ``degrees of freedom" (RDF) in the design and analysis of a study $\rightarrow$ ``p-hacking" (may not always be intentional! see Gelman \& Loken 2013)
			\item \textbf{Result:} Biased evidence base (also contributes to replication crisis)

			\item \textbf{Result:} False or biased evidence base,  (also contributes to replication crisis)
			\item \nb{\textbf{Note}:} Fabrication of data (e.g., \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-two-grad-students-uncovered-michael-lacour-fraud-and-a-way-to-change-opinions-on-transgender-rights/}{LaCour}, \href{http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-the-biggest-fabricator-in-science-got-caught}{Fujii}, \href{http://andrewgelman.com/2014/06/24/linear-true-curious-case-jens-forster/}{Foster}, \href{https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/01/high-tech-war-on-science}{Staple}) less common than other ``questionable research practices"

%%%%% SOLUTIONS

%	\begin{frame}{Maximize your contribution to scientific knowledge}
%		 \textit{Not enough to have interesting results}. Make sure your research materials (code, data, etc.) are:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item \nb{Visible}---registered in universe, even if not published
% 			\item \nb{Available}---publicly shared 
%			\item \nb{Legible}---complete, readable by humans
%			\item \nb{Replicable}---reproduce results
%		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}

%	\note{Clear steps you can take at every stage of the research process [NOTE: Here, we're focusing on individual solutions. For more disciplinary solutions, see additional notes at the end]:
%		\begin{enumerate}
%			\noteitem Design---BEFORE data collection, register your study [addresses publication bias] and submit a pre-analysis plan [addresses researcher degrees of freedom]. Complying with IRB requirements is also a key element of ethical research that meets disciplinary standards, but we won't go into that here. 
%			\noteitem Analysis---During data analysis and write-up, use good data and file management practices [helps with transparency and reproducibility], and also make sure you're following your pre-analysis plan!
%			\noteitem Dissemination---Once the analysis is done, you should prepare files for replication and upload data and code in online repositories. This is increasingly required by journals.
%		\end{enumerate}
%		Once your results enter the universe, they can be used by others for replication and meta analysis --> one datapoint among many.

%%%%% REGISTRATION	

\subsection{1. Registration}

	\begin{frame}{About Registration}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{What:} Enter your study into the appropriate disciplinary ``registry"---basically a requirement for experiments (especially in medicine)
			\item \textbf{Why:} To combat the file-drawer problem, publication bias [\nb{visibility}]; also, stake out intellectual claim!
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
%	\note{\bigskip
%		Registration is a partial, though not complete, solution to the file-drawer problem that results in publication bias. By registering your study in the appropriate repository, it is recorded as a datapoint in the universe of knowledge so that---even if not published in a journal---others can find and build off of it. 
%		
%		\bigskip
%		
%		This is now the norm in experimental work, particularly in medicine, where top journals (e.g., ICMJE) won't publish RCTs that haven't been registered. Less registration for observational work, where there is still an ongoing debate about its merits.}

%%%%% PRE-ANALYSIS PLANS	
	
\subsection{2. Pre-Analysis Plan}

	\begin{frame}{About Pre-Analysis Plans (PAP)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{What:} Detailed description of research design and data analysis plans, submitted to a registry BEFORE looking at the data.
			\item \textbf{Why:} 
				\begin{itemize}
				 	\item Tie your hands for data analysis (address researcher degrees of freedom, multiple hypothesis testing, etc.)
				 	\item Distinguish between \textit{confirmatory} and \textit{exploratory} analysis
				 	\item Boost credibility of research (get a badge from OSF!)
				 	\item Transparent methods make it easier for others to build on your work
				\end{itemize}

			\item \textbf{Why:} So you and others can better replicate your work (and to help you avoid mistakes!)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{(The Most) Basic Principles}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Structure and name files intuitively
			\item Difficult to comment/annotate too much
			\item White-space (e.g., spaces, tabs, returns) is your friend
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Structure and Name Files}
 		
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item	 Create separate scripts for merging/cleaning and data analysis, with a master-script for running it all
 			\item Give code, data files, and output logical names where possible 
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item e.g., Number folders/files sequentially in the order they should be run
 			\end{itemize}
 		\end{itemize}
 	\end{frame}
 
	 \begin{frame}{Streamline \& Annotate Code}
	 	
	 	\begin{itemize}
	 		\item Add headers (see PDEL template)
	 		\item Format scripts so they're easily readable---e.g., indent code, use ample line breaks and spaces, standardize comment syntax
	 		\item Add comments to improve reader understanding; remove unhelpful/embarrassing comments
			\item Clearly label code sections, main analyses, outputs 
			\item Give variables intuitive names like \texttt{edu\_percent} rather than \texttt{v76}
			\item Label variables and values in Stata
			\end{itemize}

	 \begin{frame}{Use working directories}

		 	\textbf{Stata}: \texttt{capture cd "$\sim$/Documents/replication\_files"}
		 	
		 	\bigskip
		 	
			 \begin{itemize}
			 	\item Saves you time, since you (or someone replicating your study) only have to change the path once if the files move AND your code will be shorter
			 	\item Particularly helpful if co-authors alternate between Mac (``/") and Windows (``$\backslash$") file extensions

		\ig[width=.6\textwidth]{phd101212s.png}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Vault original, raw data files---do not save over!
			\item Changes to files should be documented and reversible
			\item Keep ``master" versions of files in working order; create copies before experimenting
			\item Reconcile independent changes  by different users
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Manual Solutions}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Create dated versions of files (save-as) for each substantive change 
				\item With each modification, re-run ALL code to make sure nothing is broken---helps if you have a master file to run all scripts!
				\item Check-in with coauthors to ensure multiple people aren't working on the same files at the same time
				\item Keep a simple text file log to remind yourself of the location/content of major changes

	\begin{frame}{Version control software > Git > GitHub}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Version control software:} helps manage versions and edits to files (e.g., Microsoft Word's ``track changes", or Google Doc's ``suggestion" feature)---\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software}{many options!}
			\item \textbf{Git:} Open-source, ``distributed model" of version control developed by creator of Linux
			\item \textbf{GitHub:} Free, web-based service that hosts Git ``repositories" and offers a variety of features for collaboration
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
%	\note{**Version control** software help manage versions and edits to files. If you've used Word's ``track changes" feature, or Google Doc's ``suggestion" feature, these are also version control tools. But they are not very powerful. In Word, comments and track changes become unwieldy very quickly. Once you accept a change, there is no way to roll-back to a previous version of the document.
%	
%		There is a better way! Software specifically design for version-controlling that lets you *collaboratively* view, accept, and roll back changes at any stage in a file's development, and works for text files as well as code. There are a many options, but we will use **Git**, developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git is an open-source, distributed model of version control. This means that each user works with repositories (files) locally on their own computer, and then changes to these files can shared with other users.
%		
%		With Git, sharing between users can work in a number of ways. The easiest is through **GitHub**, a free, web-based service that hosts Git repositories and offers a variety of features for collaboration. If you're starting out with Git, the easiest way is through GitHub.
%	}
	
	\begin{frame}{Common problems that GitHub helps solve}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Tracking changes in code/text files}---who, what, where, when, preserved forever
			\item \textbf{Selectively reverting changes}---better than \texttt{ctrl + Z}
			\item \textbf{Experimenting}---easier than ``my\_code\_v2\_new.R"
			\item \textbf{Collaborating}---sharing/vetting/reconciling changes
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
%	\note{TRACKING CHANGES: Track changes in Word is OK, but gets messy quickly and doesn't work for code or LaTeX.
%	
%	REVERTING CHANGES: You make some edits and later decide to undo them. If the doc is still open, hit `undo' a bunch of times. BUT, what if you wanted to keep the 3rd, change you made, but undo the 1st and 2nd? The only option is to undo them all, and then try to re-execute the ones you want to keep. This is a waste of time and you may screw up. And you're completely out of luck if you already closed the file. 
%	
%	EXPERIMENTING: There's a part of your file that you like, and another part that you want to experiment with. You can ``save as" a new version to experiment on, naming it something like "mydraft\_New". In the course of working on the ``new" version, you make a number of changes, but decide that you like some parts of the old version better. How do you integrate these two documents? Word' ``combine versions" is clunky and doesn't help with non-Word files. Instead, your project directory is likely to be littered by a graveyard of obsolete documents (mydraft\_final\_110817) that keep just in case but will quickly loose track of and probably never revisit.
%	}
%	\note{COLLABORATING: You are collaborating on a project with a number of coauthors, all contributing to drafts of code and/or manuscripts. Maybe you have a Dropbox set up to sync versions with, but there's always the possibility that two people will be working on the same file at the same time, resulting in conflicting changes between files that are a pain to resolve. Although Dropbox helps with sharing, it doesn't address either of the problems described above, which are compounded with multiple authors.}
		
	\begin{frame}{How do I use GitHub?}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{GitHub website}---necessary for collaboration, but limitations
			\item \textbf{GitHub Desktop}---free desktop client for Windows/Mac, more user friendly than website
			\item \textbf{Command line (shell)}---optimal for advanced users
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

%	\note{While it's possible to use *only*  the GitHub website, this requires the desire/ability to work in your files directly through the online interface. If you have a constant internet connection and work only in text files, this may be do-able. 
%	
%	However, a much easier option is to download the free **GitHub Desktop** client for Windows and Mac (for Linux, you have to use the command line, which you can also use on Macs and PCs). This lets you work on files locally and then sync them with the remote repositories hosted online.
%	
%	Advanced users can also take full advantage of Git features by using the command line (there are limitations to what the Desktop client can do, and sometimes it is buggy.}

			\end{column}
		\end{columns}
	\end{frame}
	
%	\note{**A metaphor:** Git is Big Brother. You tell it to watch a set of files by ``adding" or ``creating" a repository and then it tracks their every change. It tells you that changes have been made, and lets you enter  (``commit")  those changes into the official record along with detailed comments about what those changes were. 
%	
%	If you're working in a type of file that Git can read---e.g. text files and most code files---it even shows you line by line what those changes were. If you don't like a particular change or ``commit" later on, you can undo (``revert") it. 
%	
%	When you open GitHub Desktop, the interface seems somewhat counterintuitive, in that it's showing you files, but you can't open or edit them from within an app, like it seems like you should be able to from a file manager. But that's not what it's doing. Think of it more as Big Brother's dashboard for changes in your document, and the whole thing makes a lot more sense.}

%		As described by \href{https://www.hastac.org/blogs/harrisonm/2013/10/12/github-academia-and-collaborative-writing}{Harrison Massey of hastac}, some Git processes are analogous to the \nb{analog editing process}.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Dropbox.} Git tracks changes in files and GitHub let's you sync/track/view/edit those changes online and with collaborators. Dropbox is a hard drive in the cloud. 
			\item \textbf{File Manager/GUI.} GitHub desktop may \textit{look} sort of like Finder (Mac) or Explorer (PC), but its function is not to let you find, click on, or open files; it's unit of operation is \textit{changes within those files}.
		\end{enumerate}

		If you haven't already ...
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Make sure you have a good text editor.} Notepad (PC) and TextEdit (Mac) will work (if you set TextEdit default file format to \texttt{.txt} and not \texttt{.rtf}). Or get a more powerful editor like \href{https://atom.io/}{Atom}. 
			\item \textbf{Create an account at \href{http://www.github.com}{GitHub}.} This gives free \textit{public} repositories, but go to the \href{https://education.github.com/}{education section} and click ``request a discount" to get free \textit{private} repositories.

	\begin{frame}{Basic vocabulary}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \nb{\textbf{Repository:}} A set of files (in a folder) that you have told Git to track, along with its associate .git files. A \nb{local} repository is the copy on your computer; a \nb{remote} repository is the copy synced online.
			\item \nb{\textbf{Commit:}} A labeled change or series of changes to files. Git tracks every change you make, and then you group these changes as desired into a ``commit" that can be commented on, reverted, etc.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{1. Create a NEW repository}
	
	Within \textbf{GitHub Desktop}, click on ``$+$" and then ``create" to make a new repository with a name and location of your choice. This creates a new folder that will be empty except for some hidden files (e.g., a .git directory).

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Create a new text file on your computer called ``README" as you normally would, and \textit{save it in your repository location}.

		Now, these changes will appear again in the "uncommitted changes" window for you to regroup or relabel.
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{6. Revert a previous commit}
		If you're unhappy with the CHANGES in a commit themselves, you can undo them by \textbf{reverting} a commit. To do this, \textbf{switch to the ``History" tab} at the top of the window and view all your previous commits. Select the commit, navigate to the dropdown menu, and click \textbf{``Revert"}:

\subsection{6. Prepare for Replication}

	\begin{frame}{Why do we care if our code is reproducible?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Unselfish reasons}---part of the scientific process and a public good
			\item \textbf{Selfish reasons}---make code more usable for yourself, catch potentially embarrassing errors before they become public, boost your transparency credibility
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Replication files should ...}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Be complete but parsimonious
			\item Run and reproduce results with one click
			\item Be readable and interpretable by humans
			\item Protect personal information
		\end{itemize}
		
		\bigskip
		
		\textbf{Caveat: }There is no single, perfect way to organize or prepare files for replication. Do what works for you (as long as it meets the above criteria)!
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{5 Steps for Prepping Files}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set-up
				\item Initial replication
				\item De-identify
				\item Edit
				\item Final replication
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{frame}
	  
		 \begin{frame}{1. Set Up}
		 	Create a \textit{new}, clearly organized folder structure for replication that you add to selectively.
		 	
		 	\begin{itemize}
		 		\item \textbf{Purpose:} 
		 		\begin{itemize}
		 			\item Ensure files are \textcolor{burntorange}{complete/parsimonious, legible}
		 			\item Protect original files
		 		\end{itemize}
		 	\end{itemize}
		 	
		 \end{frame}
		  
		 \begin{frame}{Create}
		 	\begin{enumerate}
		 		\item \textbf{A new, empty replication folder} \textit{within} your project directory (e.g., ``\texttt{replication\_files}") 
		 		\item \textbf{Subfolders:} \textit{Same as File Management tips!}
		 			\begin{itemize}
		 				\item \texttt{/code} --- scripts
		 				\item \texttt{/data\_clean} --- manipulated data
		 				\item \texttt{/data\_raw} --- original data
		 				\item \texttt{/output} --- generated tables, graphs, etc.
		 				\item \texttt{/extra} --- misc. extras (e.g., code book)
		 			\end{itemize}
		 			\item \textbf{A ``README.txt" file} to document contents, sources, software/system versions, other info necessary for replication/comprehension.
		 	\end{enumerate}
		 \end{frame}
		
		 \begin{frame}{2. Initial Replication}
		 	\textit{Copy} (don't move!) over data and code files into the replication folder and try to replicate your results.
		 	
		 	\bigskip
		 	
		 	\textbf{Purpose:}
			 	\begin{itemize}
			 		\item Make sure your code actually runs and \textcolor{burntorange}{reproduces} before you tinker with structure and formatting
			 		\item Build up your replication folder with \textcolor{burntorange}{complete and parsimonious} data/code files
			 	\end{itemize}
		 \end{frame}
		 
		\begin{frame}{Check Analysis}
			Easier to start with final analysis and work backwards to data cleaning/merging. 
			
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Copy original analysis script(s) into \texttt{replication\_files/code}
				\item Copy cleaned dataset(s) used for analysis into \texttt{replication\_files/data\_clean}
				\item Run code without changes (except for wd)
				\item Fix any bugs in the code, address discrepancies with previous results
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{frame}
		
		\begin{frame}{Check Data Clean/Merge}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item If separate from analysis, copy original merge/cleaning script(s) into \texttt{replication\_files/code}
				\item Copy original dataset(s) to \texttt{replication\_files/data}
				\item Run merge/clean code without changes (except for wd)
				\item Rerun the analysis code from above on the newly cleaned/merged data file
				\item If you get different results than step \#1, there is a discrepancy with  merging/cleaning code---fix it!
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{frame}
		
	\begin{frame}{3. De-Identifying Individual-Level Data}
		Now you know the code works and replicates, congratulations! The next step is to ensure that any shared files \textit{do not contain} data that could be used to identify individuals. 
		
		\bigskip
		
		\textbf{Purpose:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ensure you are \textcolor{burntorange}{protecting individuals' identity and private information}---this is an ethical issue for researchers, and a potential safety issue for participants
			\item Comply with legal, research board or funder requirements (e.g., HIPAA and IRB in the US) 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{What does ``de-identifying" mean?}
		\textbf{Two types of identifiers:}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textcolor{burntorange}{Direct:} Variables that is explicitly linked to the subject---\textit{e.g., name, email, address, ID number, phone number, etc.}
			\item \textcolor{burntorange}{Indirect:} Variables that, in combination, could be used to identify individuals---\textit{e.g., gender, dates (birth, program admission, etc.), geographic location (village, GPS), unusual occupations or education, etc.}
		\end{enumerate}

		See \href{https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FPF_Visual-Guide-to-Practical-Data-DeID.pdf}{this useful infographic}.

	\begin{frame}{Example of Indirect Identifiers}	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You survey teachers and collect information on \textit{gender}, \textit{classes taught}, and \textit{age}.
			\item If there is only one \textit{female}, \textit{third-grade} teacher \textit{aged 40-49} at a particular school, she is not anonymous in your data
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}		

	\begin{frame}{Dealing with Direct Identifiers}
		In general, direct identifiers---e.g., name, address, mobile number, ID number---should \textit{never} be made public. 
		
		\bigskip
			
		\textbf{Options:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Remove variables from shared dataset
			\item Pseudonymize data: replace identifiers with ``pseudonyms" that may be reversible or non-reversible---e.g., give people random names or ID numbers---goal is to be able to link datasets

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Determine Risk} = Pr(de-identifying) $\times$ sensitivity of data
			\item \textbf{Set k-anonymous level:} each record cannot be distinguished from at least $k-1$ other individuals who also appear in the data set
			\item \textbf{Select appropriate method(s) of de-identification:} aggregating data, removing certain variables or observations, reducing information/detail, adding random noise or values

\subsection{7. Share Data and Code}

	\begin{frame}{About Sharing Data and Code}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{What:} add study materials to an online repository
			\item \textbf{Why:} lasts longer than personal website, more searchable, future proof
			\item \textbf{Concerns:} 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Can usually be embargoed, or you can provide only what is necessary for replication (e.g., leave out other survey Qs)
					\item Biggest risk isn't having your data/ideas stolen, it's having your research ignored! (King 1995)

\subsection{8. Meta-Analysis}
	
	\begin{frame}{About Meta-Analysis}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{What:} Statistical analysis of a group of studies to derive a pooled estimate of the effect of a treatment; may be part of a ``systematic review"
			\item \textbf{Why:} Because individual study estimate may be biased or contain random error
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{One Study = One Data Point}
		That experiment you just ran with 3,685 participants? It's one data point among many other studies.

			\item Determine which studies to include 
			\item Determine which outcomes to measure (e.g., discrete, continuous)
			\item Select model for ``meta-regression" (e.g., RE, FE, etc.)

\begin{frame}{Solutions at the Institutional/Discipline Level}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Design-based publication:} AKA ``registered reports," moves peer review before data analysis (\href{https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/}{example})
		\item \textbf{Incentives for transparency, replication, meta-analysis:} See BITSS \href{http://www.bitss.org/lr-prizes/}{prizes} and \href{http://www.bitss.org/ssmart-grants/}{awards}, \href{https://osf.io/prereg/}{OSF pre-registration challenge}, etc.
		\item \textbf{Change norms:} e.g., journal/disciplinary standards for data sharing
		\item \textbf{Training:} Like this! more at BITSS, \href{https://cos.io/our-services/training-services/}{Center for Open Science}, etc.  
		\item \textbf{Tenure:} ``Adherence to the replication standard should be part of [tenure] judgment" (King 1995)
